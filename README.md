## Background
A GBA game developed for the 48th Ludum Dare 48 hour game jam - sadly it was only 'somewhat' finished for the jam. Oh well.. 3 days on a platform I've never programmed for isn't that bad. :grin:

It is
 written in the C language, compiled using the [devkitArm](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer) toolchain and uses [libtonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/intro.htm) with [this](https://github.com/exelotl/libtonc-template) small template. Highly recommend these!
The graphics were made with Gimp, and used [Grit](https://www.coranac.com/man/grit/html/grit.htm) to convert it into a usable data array. Here is a [little hint](https://github.com/AntonioND/gba-examples/tree/sprites-examples/graphics) for setting it up.
I haven't got time to launch it on a real GBA, but it runs OK in the [mGBA](https://mgba.io/) emulator. (Has good visualising tools, and also, it works well with GDB, so debugging was easy.)

## How to play

Wigly Hunt, our protagonist is a worm, who needs to dive deep into the abyss. He needs Your help to survive the hungry fishes. Go Help him!

Advance the menu with **A** or **START**. In-game, use the **D-Pad** to move, and **A** and **B** to attack left and right respectively.

The game currently hasn't got a save feature, but you can see your last and top score on the title screen.

That's it. Go play!

## Future plans

I promiss I'll finish this game for [GBAJam](https://itch.io/jam/gbajam21). It's has less than half the designed features in right now. Will be much more action packed. (Probably better looking and sounding if I can get someone on the resources. ðŸ˜‰ )
Probably will [stream the developement](https://www.twitch.tv/rawbits) from time-to-time, so follow me on Twitch to get the notifications when I go live!
